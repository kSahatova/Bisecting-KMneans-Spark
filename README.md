# Bisecting-KMneans-Spark
This is the implementation of the hierarchical modification of the Naive k-means algorithm written in Scala with the applied Spark framework. 
A comparison between two realizations over RDDs and DataFrames in terms of the performance has been made. Such optimization techniques as data persistence, repartitioning, and data broadcasting were tested.
